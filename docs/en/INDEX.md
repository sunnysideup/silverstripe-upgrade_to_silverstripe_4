# Upgrade your module/project to Silverstripe 4

This module helps you upgrade Silverstripe 3 modules and projects (sites)
to Silverstripe 3.7 and Silverstripe 4 with the least amount of effort.

After inspection you can then merge your upgraded project / module into your `dev/master` as you see fit.

This tool is highly customisable so that you can define your own upgrade path.

# tl;dr

## Quick install guide:

1. `cd /var/www`
2. `mkdir /var/www/upgrades`
3. `mkdir /var/www/upgrades-logs/`
4. `composer install sunnysideup/upgrade_to_silverstripe_4`
5. `cp run.me.index.short.EXAMPLE index.php`
6. edit index.php
7. `php index.php`

All paths can be customised, but the above are the defaults.

The way you run this project is by copying one of the EXAMPLE files in the root dir
to `index.php` (or anything with `index.php` will do). From the command line, you then run:
`php index.php`, and you keep running this until all tasks have been created
(i.e. you run it once for each step).

Here is what this module does, AUTOMAGICALLY:

 * clear workbench
 * checkout master of your module
 * create legacy branch
 * create upgrade branch
 * clear workbench
 * do upgrade stuff on the upgrade branch
 * set up SS4 / SS3.7 vanilla install
 * add your module / project again (upgrade branch)
 * do more upgrade stuff
 * run a dev/build and a test

Once that has completed you can MANUALLY:
 * review and fix any outstanding issues (many of them clearly marked) OR rerun full process (it is repeatable).
 * merge your upgrade branch into your master (and delete the upgrade branch)
 * you are now SS4 ready

Along the way, you may have to fix stuff and (a) start again OR (b) run the last
task again.



# prerequisites before you start:

 - projects need to be a git repository (private is fine)
 - for modules only:
     - module to be upgraded needs to be listed on packagist.   
     - composer file needs to follow a valid pattern (see below)

- **IMPORTANT** The module's / project's PHP classes are organised in meaningfull folders so that they are PSR-4 ready. This means that you create folders, similar to **silverstripe/framework**, where classes are put in semantic folder names.  
You do not need to use title case for the folder names as this will be fixed by the upgrade tool.

- Separate MyPage and MyPageController into separate classes and move them into Pages and Control folder (moving both into a PageTypes folder is fine also).
```
/code/MyPage1.php (contains class MyPage1 AND MyPage1_Controller)
/code/MyPage2.php (contains class MyPage2 AND MyPage2_Controller)
```
becomes:
```
/code/Pages/MyPage1.php (contains class MyPage1)
/code/Pages/MyPage2.php (contains class MyPage2)
/code/Control/MyPage1Controller.php (contains class MyPage1Controller)
/code/Control/MyPage2Controller.php (contains class MyPage2Controller)
```

OR:
```
/code/PageTypes/MyPage1.php (contains class MyPage1)
/code/PageTypes/MyPage2.php (contains class MyPage2)
/code/PageTypes/MyPage1Controller.php (contains class MyPage1Controller)
/code/PageTypes/MyPage2Controller.php (contains class MyPage2Controller)
```


# composer things to consider before you start


- It is recommended that your composer file follows this pattern (module only):
```json
{
    "name": "sunnysideup/my-module-name-foo-bar",
    "type": "silverstripe-module",
    "otherstuff": "goes here",
    "otherstuff": "goes here",
    "otherstuff": "goes here",
    "extra": {
        "installer-name": "my-module-name-foo-bar"
    },
}
```

 N.B. Installer-name requirement may be dropped in the future.

# git things to consider before you start

- create a tag of the module/project you are upgrading


# what does this module do?

To see a list of default upgrade tasks that will run, visit the auto-generated list of [default tasks](/docs/en/AvailableTasks.md).

To customise your list of tasks, please see config options below.

This upgrader basically wraps around https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-upgrader/
to make the upgrade more automated.

In short, it checks out dev-master of your module / project.  Adds a branch named
`3` for backwards compatability, then it ads a temporary upgrade branch.

Next, it runs a bunch of upgrades, including the ones in the original SilverStripe
upgrade module.


# installation and usage:

1.  Install this module in your web-root (or another place if needed - we use `/var/www/silverstripe-upgrade_to_silverstripe_4/` in example below) as follows:

```sh
    $ cd /var/www/
    $ composer install sunnysideup/upgrade_to_silverstripe_4
```

2.  Create a php file (e.g. `/index.php`) in your root dir, i.e. `/var/www/silverstripe-upgrade_to_silverstripe_4/` (or anywhere else where you can run it) - using the examples provided:

  - [full](/run.me.index.full.php.EXAMPLE) - overview of all settings available
  - [short](/run.me.index.short.php.EXAMPLE) - least amount of settings required


3. Run the file to upgrade your module / project - e.g.

```sh
    $ php index.php
```

Note that you can run this step by step and that you can also use the following commands:

- restart
- again
- more options become available all the time!

e.g.
```sh
    $ php index.php again
```
OR

```sh
    $ php index.php restart
```

**NB: You can run (3) as many times as you see fit**.


4. Apply any manual final fixes to the upgrade branch of your module / project to make it SS4 ready. E.g.

  a. Add $private static $table_name for every class that extends DataObject, including pages (e.g private static $table_name = 'WebPortfolioPage';).

  b. move template files (in the future this module may do this for you).

  c. Check for use statements WITHOUT name spacing - as these may need attention.

  d. etc...

5. Merge the upgrade branch into `dev-master` as you see fit.


# main config options:


### set any variable

This upgrader is super customisable. The `ModuleUpgrader` class contains magic
setters and getters so that you can set any property like this:

```php
    $moduleUpgrader->setMyVariable($value);
```

where the variable in the `ModuleUpgrader` is called `$myVariable`.

To set any of the variables in any of the tasks, you can set these as follows:

```php
    $moduleUpgrader->setListOfTasks(
        'UpdateComposerRequirements' => [
            'Package' => 'silverstripe/framework',
            'NewVersion' => '~4.0'
        ]
    );

```
where `package` and `newVersion` are variables (`properties`) in the `UpdateComposerRequirements`
task.

You can also use:

```php
    $moduleUpgrader->setVariableForTask($taskName, $variableName, $variableValue);
```

### set recipe

`->setRecipe('SS4')`:
This project comes with a few basic recipes. For example, you can set it to `SS4`
to follow a typical upgrade from `SS3` to `SS4`.  You can also set it to `SS37`
which is an upgrade path to Silvestripe 3.7.


### root directory

`->setRootDir('/var/www')`:
This is meant to be the directory where you do the work.
This should be a folder where you usually save your websites locally so that you can test your upgraded module.


### upgrade directory

`->setWebRootName('upgradeto4')`:
This is the name of the directory that is created in the root dir where the upgrade takes place.
That is, your actual module will be cloned in the `[rootdir]/[upgrade directory]` and when completed, this directory will be deleted.
**Careful! Only use this directory for automated work as it will be deleted when you run the upgrade again.**


### list of modules / projects

`->setArrayOfModules([])`:
This contains a list of modules you intend to update.
We recommend updating one module / project at a time.
For details see: [example index file](/example-index.full.php).

### temp branch

`->setNameOfTempBranch('4.1-TEMP-upgrade')`:
This is the name of the (temporary OR upgrade) branch added to your module.
All upgrade changes will be committed to this branch.
**Careful!  This branch will be deleted every time you run the update process to allow you to rerun the upgrade process.**


### start from

`->setStartFrom('mymethod')`:
Allows you to start the sequence from a particular method.
See [default tasks](/docs/en/AvailableTasks.md) for a list of tasks available.
Use the **Code** for any step to set this particular step as the first step
being executed in your upgrade sequence.

### end with

`->setEndWith('mymethod')`:
Allows you to end the sequence after a particular method.  
See [default tasks](/docs/en/AvailableTasks.md) for a list of tasks available.
Use the **Code** for any step to set this particular step as the last step
being executed in your upgrade sequence.

### log dir

`->setLogFolderDirLocation('/var/www/logs')`:
If set, a log of your upgrade will be saved in this folder.



# advanced config options:


### run immediately or create bash script?

`->setRunImmediately(true)` run immediately (DEFAULT)
`->setRunImmediately(false)`: get a bash script to run later (UNTESTED!)

NB. Bash script option is currently NOT working. You should run it immediately.


### set list of tasks

`->setListOfTasks()`:
Customise your list of tasks to run on your module during the upgrade.

```php
->setListOfTasks(
    [
        'ResetWebRootDir-1' => [],
        'AddLegacyBranch' => [],
        'ResetWebRootDir-2' => [],
        'UpdateComposerRequirements-2' => [
            'Package' => 'silverstripe/cms',
            'ReplacementPackage' => 'silverstripe/recipe-cms',
            'NewVersion' => '1.1.2'
        ],
        'Reorganise' => []
    ]
)
```
See [available tasks](/docs/en/AvailableTasks.md) and also the current [default tasks](https://github.com/sunnysideup/silverstripe-upgrade_to_silverstripe_4/blob/master/src/ModuleUpgrader.php#L105-L139).

### remove from list of tasks

`->removeFromListOfTasks('FooBar')`:
Remove an item from your list of tasks.

### add to list of tasks

`->addToListOfTasks('FooBarTask', $insertBeforeOrAfter = 'FooBarAnotherTask', $isBefore = false)`:
Add an task to your list of tasks.
See [default tasks](/docs/en/AvailableTasks.md) for a list of tasks available.

### composer environment vars

`->setComposerEnvironmentVars('COMPOSER_HOME="/home/UserName"')`:
specific stuff for your composer.


### location for the Silverstripe Upgrade module

`->setLocationOfSSUpgradeModule('~/.composer/vendor/bin/upgrade-code')`:
this module is also installed with this tool (via composer requirements)
so, in general, there is no need to set this.


### include upgrading `_ss_environment` file?

`->setIncludeEnvironmentFileUpdate(false|true)`:
we recommend to set this to false
as it is easier to do this manually.
See https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-upgrader/blob/master/README.md#environment
for details.


### run reorganise task?

`->setIncludeReorganiseTask(false|true)`:
do you want the folder names to be changed?
See https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-upgrader/blob/master/README.md#reorganise
for details.


### run webroot task

`->setIncludeWebRootUpdateTask(false|true)`:
See https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-upgrader/blob/master/README.md#webroot
for details
